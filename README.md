# XenServer Guest VM Templates
The following are unsupported, opensource, community-based XenServer Guest VM
templates.  These templates are not supported by Citrix Systems, LLC (nor its
affiliates), as well as the Xen Project:

THESE TEMPLATES ARE DESIGNED BY THE COMMUNITY, FOR THE COMMUNITY, AND INTENDED
FOR TESTING/NON-PRODUCTION PURPOSES ONLY.

By downloading and using these templates, YOU (the End-User), acknowledge:

* These Guest VM templates are provided, as-is, without warranty
* These Guest VM templates are intended for test/non-production purposes only
* The Author(s) of Guest VM templates are not responsible for any damanges

# About & How-To
This collection - by and for the opensource XenServer community - exists to
offer XenServer enthusiasts the means to more closely virtualize a Guest OS
of choice (common, esoteric, or otherwise unsupported) for individual testing,
etc.

Each of these templates is no more than a BASH script.  After downloading and
copying one or more templates, these can be installed by executing:

sh name-of-template.sh

This will make said template a 'default template', though this does not
guarantee the template will survive any major upgrade to XenServer, etc.

# More Information
For inquiries related to specific templates, email the Author(s) of each template
as - again - these are not Xen/Citrix XenServer supported.  Please feel free
to replicate this REPO or email thexenfomation@gmail.com for questions, inquiries,
or improvements
