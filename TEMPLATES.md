# TEMPLATE INFORMATION
The following file aims to add clarity to how these templates came about, what
testing was/has been done, what else is left to be done, and ... more.

# XenServer Versions
Each file is intended to be leveraged in XenServer 6.5 unless documented - inside
the template - specifically.  An example is Fedora 20, which has been tested
in XenServer 6.2, 6.2 SP1, as well as XenServer 6.5.

The basic testing requirement is that the Guest VM installs: from start to
updates; without issues that inhibit normal use, etc.

# XenServer Tools
Not all XenServer Tools, or Guest Additions, will install for Linux Distros as
while many Distros are based on major/popular Linux variants, this can be over-
come by manually installing the guest additions based on distribution.

Since the XenSource Tools are proprietary, such code will not be offered nor
shared here.

# Desirable
It is desirable, in the future, to add XenServer-version-specific screen shots
and more detailed information to ensure if a Guest VM works on multiple versions,
these templates are flagged accordingly.

# For NOW
For now, the templates are an accumulation of work thexenfomation@gmail.com has
done in his own time.
